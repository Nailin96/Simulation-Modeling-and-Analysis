# Simulation-Modeling-and-Analysis

## Project Statement
Certain bus routes in Singapore experience heavier passenger flows during morning rush hours in hotspots like MRT stations or bus interchanges. This poses a problem for commuters staying relatively close to such hotspots by bus but, not close enough within walking distance. As such, these commuters are unable to board the buses because passengers from earlier bus stops fill up the bus's capacity.

## Aim
Through this project, we hope to simulate in real-life scenarios that happen on the road and bus stops during morning rush hours, using Java script to further understand the dynamics that led to such a problem, and if possible, alleviate the issue.
