				We surveyed 30 people from different age groups to get an understanding of the difficulties they faced in travelling by bus in the morning rush hours and the urgency of their needs in solving this issue. With that, we made an affinity diagram based on the feedback we received. We categorised the responses according to their Quality Attributes and further categorised these attributes into simulation goals.
